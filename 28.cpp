Building Race

Two friends Chef and Chefina are currently on floors A and B respectively. They hear an announcement
that prizes are being distributed on the ground floor and so decide to reach the ground floor as soon as
possible.

Chef can climb down X floors per minute while Chefina can climb down Y floors per minute.
Determine who will reach the ground floor first (ie. floor number 0). In case both reach the ground floor
together, print Both .

Input Format
· The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, X, and Y - the current
floor of Chef, the current floor of Chefina, speed of Chef and speed of Chefina in floors per minute
respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:
. Chef if Chef reaches the ground floor first.
. Chefina if she reaches the ground floor first.
. Both if both reach the ground floor at the same time.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings CHEF ,
chef , Chef , and chEF are all considered the same.

Constraints

. 1≤ T ≤ 2500
· 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 100
· 1≤ X, Y ≤ 10
