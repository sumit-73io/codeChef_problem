Endless Appetizers
Life is a like a box of of mozzarella sticks. You never know what you're gonna get, but you can predict with 100 percent accuracy that it will be a
mozzarella stick.

Chef's colleague issued a challenge to Chef: "If you eat more than X mozzarella sticks, I'll give you 30 rupees for each extra one you eat".
For example, if X = 5 and Chef eats 8 sticks, he would receive 90 rupees because he ate 3 extra sticks.

You know that the restaurant serves Y mozzarella sticks per plate.
You also know that Chef received R rupees from his colleague as a result of the challenge.

What's the maximum number of plates of mozzarella sticks that Chef could have ordered?

Note:

. Chef won't order a new plate till he finishes eating all the sticks from the previous one.
. However, it's possible that Chef didn't finish all the sticks from the fina/ plate he ordered.
See the explained examples below for more clarification.

Input Format
. The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
. Each test case consists of one line of input, containing three space-separated integers X, Y, and R- the lower limit on the number of
sticks, the number of sticks on a single plate, and the money received by Chef.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the maximum number of plates Chef could have ordered.

Constraints

. 1< T < 104
. 1< X â‰¤ 100
. 1<Y <10
. 0<R<3.104
. It is guaranteed that R is a multiple of 30.
